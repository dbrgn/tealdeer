A very fast implementation of [tldr](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr) in
Rust: Simplified, example based and community-driven man pages.

If you pronounce "tldr" in English, it sounds somewhat like "tealdeer". Hence the project name :)

In case you're in a hurry and just want to quickly try tealdeer, you can find static
binaries on the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer/releases/)!


## Goals

High level project goals:

- [x] Download and cache pages
- [x] Don't require a network connection for anything besides updating the cache
- [x] Command line interface similar or equivalent to the [NodeJS client][tldr-node-client]
- [x] Be fast

A tool like `tldr` should be as frictionless as possible to use. It should be
easy to invoke (just `tldr tar`, not using another subcommand like `tldr find
tar`) and it should show the output as fast as possible.

tealdeer reaches these goals. During a (highly non-scientific) test (see
[#38](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer/issues/38) for details), I tested the
invocation speed of `tldr <command>` for a few of the existing clients:

| Client | Times (ms) | Avg of 5 (ms) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Tealdeer](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer/) | `15/11/5/5/11` | `9.4` (100%) |
| [C client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-cpp-client) | `11/5/12/11/15` | `10.8` (115%) |
| [Bash client](https://github.com/pepa65/tldr-bash-client) | `15/19/22/25/24` | `21.0` (223%) |
| [Go client by k3mist](https://github.com/k3mist/tldr/) | `98/96/100/95/101` | `98.8` (1'051%) |
| [Python client](https://github.com/lord63/tldr.py) | `152/148/151/158/140` | `149.8` (1'594%) |
| [NodeJS client](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr-node-client) | `169/171/170/170/170` | `170.0` (1'809%) |

tealdeer was the winner here, although the C client and the Bash client are in
the same speed class. Interpreted languages are clearly much slower to invoke,
a delay of 170 milliseconds is definitely noticeable and increases friction for
the user.

These are the clients I tried but failed to compile or run:
[Haskell client](https://github.com/psibi/tldr-hs),
[Ruby client](https://github.com/YellowApple/tldrb),
[Perl client](https://github.com/skaji/perl-tldr),
[Go client by anoopengineer](https://github.com/anoopengineer/tldr/),
[PHP client](https://github.com/BrainMaestro/tldr-php).


## Usage

    tldr [options] <command>
    tldr [options]

    Options:

        -h --help            Show this screen
        -v --version         Show version information
        -l --list            List all commands in the cache
        -f --render <file>   Render a specific markdown file
        -o --os <type>       Override the operating system [linux, osx, sunos]
        -u --update          Update the local cache
        -c --clear-cache     Clear the local cache
        -q --quiet           Suppress informational messages
        --config-path        Show config file path
        --seed-config        Create a basic config

    Examples:

        $ tldr tar
        $ tldr --list

    To control the cache:

        $ tldr --update
        $ tldr --clear-cache

    To render a local file (for testing):

        $ tldr --render /path/to/file.md


## Installing

### Static Binaries (Linux)

Static binary builds (currently for Linux only) are available on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/dbrgn/tealdeer/releases).
Simply download the binary for your platform and run it!

Builds for other platforms are planned.

### Cargo Install (any platform)

Build and install the tool via cargo...

    $ cargo install tealdeer

### From Source (any platform)

tealdeer requires at least Rust 1.30.

Debug build with logging enabled:

    $ cargo build --features logging

Release build without logging:

    $ cargo build --release

To enable the log output, set the `RUST_LOG` env variable:

    $ export RUST_LOG=tldr=debug

### From AUR (Arch Linux)

If you're an Arch Linux user, you can also install the package from the AUR:

- [tealdeer](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tealdeer/)
- [tealdeer-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/tealdeer-git/)

### From Homebrew (macOS)

 If you're a macOS user, you can install the package from the Homebrew with the following command:

    $ brew install tealdeer

### Through Nix (NixOS, Linux with Nix or macOS with Nix)

If you have the Nix package manager, you can use [attribute `tealdeer` from Nixpkgs](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html#tealdeer).

E.g. to run tealdeer without permanently installing it:

    $ nix run nixpkgs.tealdeer -c tldr tar

or to install tealdeer into the user environment:

    $ nix-env -iA nixos.tealdeer

## Configuration

The tldr command can be customized with a config file called `config.toml`.
Creating the config file can be done manually or with the help of tldr:

    $ tldr --seed-config

The configuration file path follows OS conventions. It can be queried with the following command:

    $ tldr --config-path

### Style

Using the config file, the style (e.g. colors or underlines) can be customized.

Possible styles:

- `description`: The initial description text
- `command_name`: The command name as part of the example code
- `example_text`: The text that describes an example
- `example_code`: The example itself, except the `command_name` and `example_variable`
- `example_variable`: The variables in the example

Currently supported attributes:

- `foreground` (color string, see below)
- `background` (color string, see below)
- `underline` (`true` or `false`)
- `bold` (`true` or `false`)

The currently supported colors are:

- `black`
- `red`
- `green`
- `yellow`
- `blue`
- `purple`
- `cyan`
- `white`

Example customization:

## Bash Autocompletion

To get bash autocompletion, simply rename the file `bash_tealdeer` to `tldr`
and copy it to `/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/tldr`.
